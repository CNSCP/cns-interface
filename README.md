## About

This project contains a [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) application. The application demonstrates the usage of the CNS SDK. The application works on any POSIX-compliant shell (sh, dash, ksh, zsh, bash), in particular on these platforms: unix, linux, macOS, and Windows WSL.

## Installing

To **install** or **update** the application, you should fetch the latest version from this Git repository. To do that, you may either download and unpack the repo zip file, or clone the repo using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CNSCP/cns-example.git
```

Either method should get you a copy of the latest version. It is recommended (but not compulsory) to place the repo in the `~/cns-example` project directory. Go to the project directory and install Node.js dependancies with:

```sh
npm install
```

Your application should now be ready to rock.

## Usage

Once installed, run the application with:

```sh
npm run start
```

To shut down the application, hit `ctrl-c`.
